          Hi, Iâ€™m Suhaib Rashid, a Management Information Systems graduate from the University of Texas at Austin 
          with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges. I have hands-on experience with 
          Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and AI-driven solutions, including developing a GPT-4-based research summarization 
          tool and optimizing supply chain operations at Aramco. I thrive on solving complex business problems that drive 
          tangible value and am motivated by a continuous curiosity to learn and contribute meaningfully to any organization I join.
